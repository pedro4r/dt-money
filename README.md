# DT-MONEY
Financial Manager Application

![Demo Animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedro4r/jupiter-ui/assets/images/dt-money.jpg)

This application was designed for straightforward personal financial management. With it, you can add income and expense transactions, enabling you to see the total income/outcome and the final balance. Additionally, you can also search for transactions. All information is being stored in the browser's local storage.

We are working on integrating Google OAuth and a Planet Scale database to enhance the experience further. Furthermore, we are adding new features such as data editing and deletion.
